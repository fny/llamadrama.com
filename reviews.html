<p><b>Great fun -- our new favorite!</b><br />
Absolutely love this card game. This is our new favorite for family game night. The rules make it easy to pick up quickly and to introduce new players. Games typically last 5 - 15 minutes and include enough strategy and chance to be great fun. I took it along when we went out with a group of middle and high schoolers and they loved it as well. If you have more than five players I definitely recommend buying a second pack, but we've played it with five players and a single pack and had fun as well. You can't go wrong buying this card game!<br />

<p><b>Quick, Easy, and Tons of Fun!!</b><br />
This game is really fun and can get petty real quick! It doesn’t take long to get a handle on the game, and each round goes by quick. Highly recommend for both kids and adults, it’s definitely a must-have in any game collection!

<p><b>Easy to learn - fun unique card game</b><br />Played this game as part of the beta test. The game only took a few minutes to get started playing with the family around the table. The game was then spontaneously picked up by a few youth ( 13-18 years old) and since it is easy to learn people joined and transitioned through the group. The games are relatively short (20 minutes?) with everyone always involved to make it very social. The humorous graphics on the cards help keep it light-hearted (Even when the Big Llama comes your way.) It feels like a game of chance, but there are clearly skill components I learned over the various hands; but not enough strategy decisions that it slows down the game (or is even required to have fun).<br />
