## Setup

1. Each player gets:
    - 3 cards face down (don’t look!)
    - 3 cards face up on top of those
    - 5 cards to hold in their hand
2. Put the leftover cards in a pile in the middle as the Draw Pile.
3. Leave space next to it for a Discard Pile and a Play Pile.

Below is an example of a three-player game:

</div>

## Goal and Strategy

The first player to play all their cards wins. Strengthen your hand by saving powerful cards and playing
weak ones until the Draw Pile runs out. Anticipate your opponent’s responses and strategically play
cards that improve your chances on the next turn.

## Setup

Deal each player 3 cards face down hidden from everyone, 3 cards face up on top of those, and 5 cards
to hold hidden from other players. Put the leftover cards in a pile in the middle as the Draw Pile. Leave
space next to it for a Discard Pile and a Play Pile. Below is an example of a 3-player game.

## Game Play

 - Decide who goes first and take turns clockwise.
 - On a turn, play one or multiple identical cards from your hand into the Play Pile.
   - If the Play Pile is empty, play any card. If not, play one or multiple identical cards that match or beat the top card of the Play Pile.
   - If you can’t play a card, add the entire Play Pile to your hand, ending your turn.
 - Before ending a turn, draw cards from the Draw Pile to keep at least 5 in your hand. This only applies until the Draw Pile runs out.
 - If at any time four identical cards are played together, or in a row by different players, the Play Pile is discarded and the player completing the set plays again.



## Winning

 - Only when your hand is empty, you may play from your face up cards. Keep them on the table for all to see. Play multiple face up cards on a turn only if they are identical.
 - When those are finished, randomly play one face down card per turn without peeking.
 - If a face up card or a face down card cannot go on the Play Pile, add that card and the entire Play Pile to your hand, ending your turn. Finish your hand again before playing face up or face down cards.
 - The first person to finish all their cards wins!
