## Setup

1. Each player gets:
    - 3 cards face-down (don’t look!)
    - 3 cards face-up on top of those
    - 5 cards to hold in their hand
2. Put the leftover cards in a pile in the middle as the Draw Pile.
3. Leave space next to it for a Discard Pile and a Play Pile.

Below is an example of a three-player game:

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 1em;">
  <img src="/assets/holiday-example.jpg" alt="Three cards face-down, three cards face-up, and five cards in hand." style="border: 1em solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)" />
</div>

## How to Win

Be the first to play all of your cards!

## Normal Turns

1. Pick someone to start, then take turns in a circle.
2. On a turn, play one or more of the same card from your hand.
    - If the Play Pile is empty, play any card.
    - If not, play a card that is the same or better than the top card on the Play
      Pile (check the Llama Hierarchy to know which cards are better).
3. If you cannot play a card, pick up all the cards in the Play Pile and add
   them to your hand, ending your turn.
4. After a turn, draw cards from the Draw Pile to keep at least 5 in your hand.
   This only applies until the Draw Pile finishes.

## Final Turns

5. Once your hand is empty, play your face-up cards. When those are
   finished, play your face-down cards! When a card fails,
   pickup that card and the Play Pile and go back to taking
   normal turns on your next turn.
6. The first person with no cards left wins!
