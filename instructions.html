<h1>Setup</h1>

<p>Deal each player three cards face-down, three cards face-up, and five cards for their hand. Leave the remaining cards face-down as the Draw Pile. Leave some space on the table for a Play Pile and a Discard Pile.</p>

<p>Below is an example of a three-player game:</p>

<h1>How to Win</h1>

<p>The first player to get rid of all their cards wins!</p>

<h1>How to Play</h1>

<p>Choose a player to go first and rotate clockwise. They can play any card to start the Play Pile.</p>

<p>On each turn, you must match or beat the top card of the Play Pile. You may play more than one of the same number or face card on your turn. Higher numbered cards beat lower numbered cards. Special Llama cards have their own rules. You can find these rules on the cards themselves or on the Llama Hierarchy instruction card.</p>

<p>If four cards of the same number or face are played in a row (either in one turn or over consecutive turns), the Play Pile is discarded and the last player plays again. When the Play Pile is empty, a player can play any card to restart the Play Pile.</p>

<p>At the end of a turn, if you have fewer than five cards, draw cards from the Draw Pile to have five in your hand. If on your turn you can't play a card, pick up the Play Pile (yes, the entire Play Pile) and add it to your hand, ending your turn.</p>
